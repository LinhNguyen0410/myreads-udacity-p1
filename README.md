# MyReads Project

The MyReads project is a book tracking web application built using React. Here's a brief description:

MyReads allows users to organize and track their reading progress by categorizing books into three main shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. Users can easily move books between shelves to reflect their current reading status. The application consists of two main pages: the main page and the search page.

On the main page, users can view their books organized into the three shelves mentioned above. They can also navigate between shelves and update the status of each book by moving it to a different shelf.

The search page enables users to search for new books by typing in keywords. As users type, search results dynamically appear on the page. Users can categorize search results into shelves and add them to their collection. Changes made on the search page are seamlessly reflected on the main page, ensuring consistency across the application.

## Main Page URL:

URL: /
Description: This URL takes users to the main page of the MyReads application.

## Search Page URL:

URL: /search
Description: Accessing this URL directs users to the search page of the MyReads application.

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## What You're Getting

```bash
├── README.md - This file.
├── package.json # npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

    ├── index.css # Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
    └── index.js # You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query);
```

- query: `<String>`
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
